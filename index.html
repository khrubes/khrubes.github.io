                  I worked on the web client for Inbox by Gmail, under the mentorship of two Google engineers.

                        I developed a debugging page for internal use, to show the status of client-agnostic experiments within Inbox with a simple keyboard shortcut. This project involved both back end development, piping data from an internal api, and front end development, designing the page and filling it with the supplied data.

                      <b>Promotions UI Framework</b> I implemented a framework for showing Promotions, a non-modal dialog that displays a message to the user and allows them to take a few actions. This framework has been developed to be fully extendable, and the UI is flexible enough to be built with a variety of UI components.

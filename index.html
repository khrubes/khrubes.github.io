               I was born and raised in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Have you ever heard of the term "Iowa-nice"? It's the idea that Iowans are the friendliest people you'll meet. It'd like to think that's true, and try to fulfill the stereotype!

                  I worked on the web client for Inbox by Gmail, under the mentorship of two Google engineers.

                      <b>Experiments Debugging Page</b>
                        I developed a debugging page for internal use, to show the status of client-agnostic experiments within Inbox with a simple keyboard shortcut. This project involved both back end development, piping data from an internal api, and front end development, designing the page and filling it with the supplied data.

                    <li>
                      <b>Promotions UI Framework</b> I implemented a framework for showing Promotions, a non-modal dialog that displays a message to the user and allows them to take a few actions. This framework has been developed to be fully extendable, and the UI is flexible enough to be built with a variety of UI components.

                    <li>
                      <b>Writing Design Docs</b> Because this framework will be used for a variety of future Promotions, it required careful planning to make sure it is fully extensible and consistent with the rest of the app. I wrote a detailed design doc covering design, implementation, concerns, and included a task estimate for how long implementation would take.

                  I worked on a small team comprised of German and French engineers to develop a web apps for internal use. I often attended meetings and corresponded with coworkers in German.

                        I worked with another engineer to reimplement an old employee directory site from scratch. The site included a search page, employee profile pages,

                      <b>HR Trainings Manager</b> Two other engineers and I implemented a web app for HR to manage employee trainings. The app allowed an employee to select multiple trainings from a catalog and send a request via email to their manager, who could then send the training plan of their direct reports to the corresponding HR manager. The HR manager could then export all the trainings they recieved into an Excel spreadsheet. The UI for this app required support for English, French, and German.
